Classic Game of BattleShip on Python3

Game is on a 10x10 board with the CPU playing the user

Goal was to use minimal packages, even without any visual packages

As I update the game, I'm mainly trying to make the CPU's coordinate selection more strategical, so far
the CPU changes it's strategy when a target was hit
